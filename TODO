PART A. Image, camera
    1. solve problem: when target (green light) is small, identification bounces around
    2. only the most circular or elliptical shape (and not the largest shape) should be selected as green light (GL)
    3. fix the camera's focal length such that it could resolve objects at 25m sharp.
    4. allow reading from a yaml file the rgb lower and upper limits of color (should we do: rgb or hsv?)

PART B. Radar.
    1. coordinates transformation (from camera to lidar)
    2. grouping the points
    3. get the estimated distance of GL. The error should be within 5cm. Best within 3cm.

DEADLINE: APRIL 25th!!!!!
